# MiniShell_42

The goal of this group project is to create a simple shell (just like a small bash or zsh), with basics commands and builtins. Not only will it help you to learn more about a Shell but it will teach you the basic of working with a groupe.
This project was realized with [https://github.com/Tonio2] and [https://github.com/cstpka].
